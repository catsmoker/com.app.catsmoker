   Launch the `LSPosed_mod` Manager.

6. **Enable the Module**

   - Search for `catsmoker` and enable the module.

   The supported games will be automatically added to the scope.

8. **Force Stop the Game**

## Usage

Once you've installed and activated the Catsmoker module, it will automatically spoof your device information for supported gaming applications. There's no additional configuration required. Simply force stop and open the games you want to play, and enjoy the benefits of device spoofing.

You can untick the games you don't want to spoof in the lsposed app. A reboot may be required.
